# clsx-custom

This is a VS Code plugin forked from [ClassNameify][https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=epadzensky.Classnameify], which was referenced from [classNames](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames) library, and inspired by [clsx][https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ElegantStack.clsx]. This build seeks to enable users to have simple custom options to convert their codebase's string class names to use their very own prefix in place of the usual `classNames` or `clsx` prefixes, as well as whether to use `single-quotes` / `double-quotes`.

To use it, simply right click a className prop on a react or preact component and click `clsx-custom` in the context menu
